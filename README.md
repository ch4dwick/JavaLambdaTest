# LambdaTest
Reference class to remind me how Lambdas work in Java. I kept forgetting how to implment the darn things or how it worked so I just put this up here to remind me.

[App.java](./App.java) - implments three diffent ways of using Lambda
1) Via inline anonymous class
2) Pass by reference with two different variations.
3) Show that threads can do it too!
